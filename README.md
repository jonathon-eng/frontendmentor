Hi all, this is my first attempt at doing something on Frontend challenges.

I'm not super familiar with a lot of what's going on, but I'm trying to get myself to learn it because it seems fun.

That being said, I am learning everything from what I see online and trying to apply the knowledge. It hasn't been so easy, but it

is a challenge I want to overcome and continue to learn. I will be trying to update this as frequently as possible.
